There are two classes, one that creates a  Jframe which will act as our panel for the key listener and another class that has the code for the logic of the game. The game works by using a 2D array and then using for loops each move is executed. Comments are added to explain what each for loop does. The game tests several conditions each through a different method with appropriate names. To check if game is over or not, we test whether all cells are filled and whether a valid move is possible. To check if we need to add a new number, after each move we test if there are empty cells. To check if a move is valid we check if two adjacent cells have the same value and if there is an empty adjacent cell to any cell. 

After each move the game checks the value of all arrays and sees if we have reached 2048 or not, if yes the game is won and restarted. 

Commands to restart and quit the game have been added. 


To run the game, launch the game class. Ensure that the mouse pointer is focused on the panel that is created for the game to detect key strokes, and enjoy.
